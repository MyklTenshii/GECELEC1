                What is Netiquette?
Netiquette, or network etiquette,
is concerned with the "proper"
way to communicate in an
online environment. Consider
the following "rules," adapted
from Virginia Shea's the Core
Rules of Netiquette, whenever
you communicate in the virtual
world.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="kuro">
               <br> REMEMBER THE GOLDEN
RULE- Make a good impression
- treat others with the same
respect that you would like to
receive and avoid
confrontational or offensive
language.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="kuro">
                <br>AVOID SLANG, ACRONYMS,
AND TEXT TALK –
Communicating effectively in
college and business
environments requires the use
of correct terminology, spelling,
and grammar that can easily be
understood. For example, use
“your” instead of “ur”.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="kuro">
               <br> AVOID “SCREAMING” IN
TYPED MESSAGES – Typing
an entire message using all
capital letters is known as
“screaming”. It is distracting and
generally frowned upon in
professional environments.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="kuro">
               <br> PROOFREAD YOUR
MESSAGES BEFORE
SENDING THEM –
Proofreading your messages
before you send them is a best
practice for effective and
efficient communication.
            </h1>
            <h1 class="kuro">
               <br> EXERCISE GOOD
JUDGMENT WHEN SHARING
INFORMATION WITH
OTHERS
ONLINE – E-mail and chat
messages that you send or
receive are considered private
and should not be forwarded or
copied to others without gaining
the consent of all involved
participants.
<br>To protect your privacy and
safety, do not share online any
sensitive personal information
such as:
- Your home address or phone
number
- Personal conversations
- Social plans, such as
vacations
- Financial information
- Usernames, passwords, or
hints
- Anything personal that you
would not want shared by
others over the Internet.
<br>If the material you share with
others online came from
another source, make every
effort to gain permission from
the original author or copyright
holder. Copying someone else's
work and passing it off as your
own is plagiarism. It damages
your reputation and could
subject you to serious academic
and legal consequences.
            </h1>
    <h1 class="kuro">
        <br>RESPECT DIVERSITY IN
VIEWPOINTS - Be constructive
and respectful when sharing
opinions, beliefs, and criticisms,
or responding to those of others
in the conversation.
